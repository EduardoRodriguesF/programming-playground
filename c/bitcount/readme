bits are always flip from right to left.

0010011 - 1
=
0010010


0010010 - 1
=
0010001


Because the rightmost bit is the smallest, subtracting any number by 1 will always flip the rightmost (smallest) bit. When we use the AND bitwise operator, 
the new value and the previous one won't match.

0010010 & 0010001

Therefore: 0010000
It is removed.
